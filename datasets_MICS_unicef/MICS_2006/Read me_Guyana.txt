In this compressed WINZIP folder you will find the MICS3 datasets for the selected 
country. 

Four SPSS data files were produced, corresponding to the four main units of analysis: 
Households -  hh.sav 
Household members - hl.sav
Women in reproductive age (15-49 years of age) – wm.sav
Mothers or primary caretakers of children under the age of five. – ch.sav


The characteristics of the data such as sample size, weights, variable labels and 
information on recoded or imputed variables can be found within the survey archive 
which will be made available shortly on http://www.childinfo.org/mics3_surveys.html. 
The survey archive will also contain the questionnaires and information on the sampling
